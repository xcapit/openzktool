### Scene 4: Multi-Chain Verification (35-60s)
**Visual**: Terminal showing dual verification
**Voiceover**:
> "The same proof verifies on multiple blockchains. Watch it verify on Ethereum..."

**Terminal Output**:
```
🔐 OpenZKTool - Multi-Chain Verification
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⛓️  [Ethereum/EVM] Deploying verifier...
✅ Contract deployed: 0xabcd...
✅ Proof verified on-chain
   Gas used: 250,000
   Time: 2.3s

🌟 [Stellar Soroban] Deploying verifier...
✅ Contract deployed: CBPB...
✅ Proof verified on-chain
   Fee: 0.00001 XLM
   Time: 1.8s

✨ TRUE INTEROPERABILITY: One proof, two blockchains
```

**Voiceover (continued)**:
> "...and then on Stellar Soroban. Same proof, different chains. True interoperability."

---

### Scene 5: Key Benefits (60-75s)
**Visual**: Animated cards flying in with icons
**Voiceover**:
> "Privacy-preserving. Production-grade performance. Multi-chain ready. Open source."

**On Screen Cards** (appear sequentially):
1. 🔐 **Privacy-Preserving**
   "Prove without revealing"

2. ⚡ **Lightning Fast**
   "<50ms verification"

3. ⛓️ **Multi-Chain**
   "Ethereum + Soroban + more"

4. 🔓 **Open Source**
   "AGPL-3.0 | Digital Public Good"

---

### Scene 6: Call to Action (75-90s)
**Visual**: Website homepage with GitHub stars counter
**Voiceover**:
> "Ready to build private dApps? OpenZKTool is free, open source, and ready to deploy."

**On Screen Text**:
- 🌐 **openzktool.vercel.app**
- 🚀 **GitHub: xcapit/stellar-privacy-poc**
- 📖 **Full documentation available**

**Final Frame**:
```
OpenZKTool
Zero-Knowledge Proofs Made Easy
─────────────────────────────────
✅ PoC Complete | 🚧 MVP in Progress
🌍 Digital Public Good | 🔓 AGPL-3.0
```

## Voiceover Script (Complete)

**Total words**: 89 words (~45 seconds of speech at natural pace)

```
What if you could prove you're eligible for a service without revealing any personal data?

Traditional identity verification exposes everything: your age, balance, location.

OpenZKTool uses Zero-Knowledge SNARKs. Prove you meet requirements without revealing the actual data.

The same proof verifies on multiple blockchains. Watch it verify on Ethereum, and then on Stellar Soroban. Same proof, different chains. True interoperability.

Privacy-preserving. Production-grade performance. Multi-chain ready. Open source.

Ready to build private dApps? OpenZKTool is free, open source, and ready to deploy.

## Success Criteria

Video should communicate:
1. ✅ What problem OpenZKTool solves (privacy + compliance)
2. ✅ How it works (ZK-SNARKs in simple terms)
3. ✅ Key differentiator (multi-chain interoperability)
4. ✅ Open source nature (AGPL-3.0, DPG)
5. ✅ Clear call to action (visit website, GitHub)

---

**Notes**:
- Keep technical jargon minimal for Scene 1-3
- Show actual working code/terminal for credibility
- Emphasize "Digital Public Good" status
- Highlight both Ethereum AND Soroban equally
- End with strong CTA (not just "learn more")

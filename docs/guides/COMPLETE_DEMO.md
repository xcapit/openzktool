## 📊 What Gets Demonstrated

### Private Inputs (Hidden):
- Age: 25 years
- Balance: $150
- Country: Argentina (ID 32)

### What Gets Proven:
- ✅ Age is between 18-99
- ✅ Balance ≥ $50
- ✅ Country is allowed

### What Verifier Learns:
- **Only:** `kycValid = 1` (all checks passed)
- **Not:** Exact age, balance, or country

---

## 🎓 Educational Value

### Perfect For:

1. **Students** learning about ZK proofs
2. **Developers** exploring ZK implementations
3. **Business stakeholders** understanding use cases
4. **Conference presentations** with live demos
5. **Video content** creation
6. **Technical interviews** demonstrating knowledge

### Learning Outcomes:

After watching, viewers will understand:
- ✅ What Zero-Knowledge means (intuitively)
- ✅ How ZK proofs work (technically)
- ✅ Why ZK matters (real-world benefits)
- ✅ How to implement ZK (practical steps)
- ✅ Where to use ZK (applications)

## ⚙️ Customization

### Auto-Pause vs Manual Pause

**Auto-pause (default):**
```bash
bash full_demo.sh
```
Pauses 2 seconds between sections automatically.

**Manual pause (for presentations):**
```bash
DEMO_PAUSE=manual bash full_demo.sh
```
Wait for ENTER key at each section.

### Adjust Pause Duration

Edit the script:
```bash
PAUSE_TIME=2  # Change to 3, 4, 5... for longer pauses
```

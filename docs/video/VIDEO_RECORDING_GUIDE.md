## üìù Narration Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

```
"Welcome to the Stellar Privacy SDK.

In this demo, I'll show you how Zero-Knowledge Proofs
enable privacy-preserving compliance on multiple blockchains.

We'll generate a cryptographic proof, verify it on Ethereum,
and then verify the SAME proof on Stellar.

All without revealing any private data.

Let's dive in."
```

---

### Problem Statement (0:30 - 1:30)

```
"Today, banks and fintechs face a critical problem:

Public blockchains expose all transaction data.
Account balances, amounts, counterparties - everything is visible.

For traditional finance, this is a non-starter.

Current KYC processes require users to share everything:
Their ID, passport, bank statements, complete financial history.

But the service only needs to know ONE thing:
Does the user meet the requirements?

This creates a dilemma: Privacy versus Compliance.

Banks need privacy but can't use public blockchains.
Regulators need transparency but can't accept fully private systems.

The Stellar Privacy SDK solves this."
```

---

### Solution (1:30 - 2:30)

```
"With Zero-Knowledge Proofs, you can prove something
without revealing the underlying data.

Let me show you how:

Alice wants to access a DeFi platform.
The platform requires:
- Age over 18
- Balance over $50
- Approved country

Alice HAS:
- Age 25
- Balance $150
- Lives in Argentina

Instead of sharing these exact values,
Alice generates a cryptographic proof.

This proof is only 800 bytes.
It proves she meets ALL requirements.
But it reveals NOTHING about her actual age, balance, or country.

Watch as we generate this proof now..."
```

---

### Proof Generation (2:30 - 3:30)

```
"The system is now generating a Zero-Knowledge Proof using:
- Circom circuits
- Groth16 SNARKs
- BN254 elliptic curve

This takes less than one second.

[Pause as proof generates]

Done! We now have an 800-byte proof.

This proof contains mathematical commitments on an elliptic curve.
It proves Alice's data satisfies the constraints.
But the proof itself contains ZERO private information.

Her age, balance, and country remain completely private.

Now let's verify this proof on two different blockchains..."
```

---

### Ethereum Verification (3:30 - 5:00)

```
"First, Ethereum.

We're starting a local Ethereum node using Foundry's Anvil.
Deploying a Solidity smart contract.
And submitting Alice's proof for verification.

[Pause as verification runs]

The contract performs a BN254 elliptic curve pairing check.
This is the cryptographic operation that validates the proof.

[Pause for result]

Success! The Ethereum blockchain confirms:
Alice's proof is valid.
She meets all requirements.

But the blockchain has NO IDEA what her actual age, balance,
or country are.

The cost? About $2 worth of gas at current prices.
The time? Less than 50 milliseconds.

Now let's verify the SAME proof on Stellar..."
```

---

### Stellar Verification (5:00 - 6:30)

```
"Now we're moving to Stellar's Soroban smart contracts.

This is the key: We're using the EXACT SAME 800-byte proof.
No regeneration. No modification.
The same proof that worked on Ethereum.

We're building a Rust contract to WebAssembly.
Starting a local Stellar network.
And deploying the verifier contract.

[Pause as verification runs]

The Soroban contract validates the proof structure.
It checks all the field elements are valid.

[Pause for result]

Success again! Stellar confirms:
The proof is valid.
Alice meets all requirements.

And again, the blockchain knows NOTHING about her private data.

The cost? Less than a penny.
The contract size? Just 2.1 kilobytes of WebAssembly.

This is true multi-chain interoperability."
```

---

### Conclusion (6:30 - 7:00)

```
"Let's recap what we just saw:

ONE proof. TWO blockchains.
Complete privacy. Full compliance.

Alice proved she met the requirements without revealing:
- Her exact age
- Her exact balance
- Her country

The proof worked on both Ethereum and Stellar.
It would also work on Polygon, Avalanche, BSC,
and any other EVM-compatible chain.

This opens up massive possibilities:
Banks can use public blockchains privately.
DeFi can verify credentials without seeing them.
Compliance and privacy can finally co-exist.

The Stellar Privacy SDK makes this real.

GitHub repo is open source.
This is an open source project focused on privacy and compliance.

Thanks for watching!"

üîê Solving the Privacy vs Compliance Dilemma in Blockchain

I'm excited to share our work on the Stellar Privacy SDK -
a solution that enables banks and fintechs to use public
blockchains while maintaining data privacy.

Using Zero-Knowledge Proofs, institutions can:
‚úÖ Verify compliance without seeing private data
‚úÖ Use the same proof across multiple blockchains
‚úÖ Maintain regulatory transparency with selective disclosure

In this 7-minute demo, we show:
‚Ä¢ Proof generation (<1 second)
‚Ä¢ Verification on Ethereum
‚Ä¢ Verification on Stellar (same proof!)
‚Ä¢ Complete privacy preservation

This opens up blockchain adoption for traditional finance.

This is being developed as an open source digital public good.

Watch the demo and let me know what you think!

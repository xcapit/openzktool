# Stellar Privacy SDK ‚Äî Grant Proposal

**Project Name:** Stellar Privacy SDK (Brand: ZKPrivacy)
**Award Type:** Stellar Community Fund ‚Äî Build Award
**Category:** Infrastructure & Services / Developer Tools
**Requested Budget:** $80,000 USD
**Duration:** 6 months
**Status:** ‚úÖ Approved

---

## üìã Executive Summary

The **Stellar Privacy SDK** is a production-ready toolkit enabling developers, retail partners, and financial institutions to execute **privacy-preserving transactions** on Stellar using **Zero-Knowledge SNARKs** (ZK-SNARKs) ‚Äî with full regulatory compliance and auditability for real-world institutional use.

**The Problem:** Public blockchains expose every balance, counterparty, and transaction amount. This lack of privacy prevents institutional adoption and creates regulatory barriers.

**The Solution:** Zero-Knowledge Proofs that enable:
- Private transactions (hidden amounts, balances, counterparties)
- Regulatory transparency (full disclosure to authorized auditors)
- Developer-ready integration (deploy in hours, not months)
- Compliance by design (built-in KYC/AML audit capabilities)

1. **Enable TradFi Adoption:** Bridge the gap between traditional finance and blockchain by providing privacy with compliance
2. **Developer Enablement:** Create an easy-to-use SDK for integrating ZK proofs into Stellar applications
3. **Regulatory Compliance:** Build audit layers that satisfy global regulatory requirements
4. **Ecosystem Growth:** Onboard institutional partners and increase Stellar transaction volume

### Success Criteria

‚úÖ Production-ready ZK circuits and Soroban contracts
‚úÖ Complete JS/TS SDK with comprehensive documentation
‚úÖ Banking/regulatory integration layer functional
‚úÖ Independent security audit completed

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The **Stellar Privacy SDK** addresses a critical barrier to institutional blockchain adoption: the lack of privacy with regulatory compliance. By combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs with selective disclosure mechanisms, we enable financial institutions to:

1. Execute private transactions on Stellar
2. Maintain full regulatory compliance
3. Onboard with minimal integration effort
4. Scale to production with confidence

Our team has demonstrated capability (previous SCF grant, working POC, academic partnerships), clear technical vision (production-ready architecture), strong go-to-market strategy (pilot partners ready), and commitment to the Stellar ecosystem (open source, long-term support).

With $80,000 in funding over 6 months, we will deliver a production-ready SDK that unlocks TradFi adoption, increases Stellar transaction volume, and establishes privacy + compliance as a competitive advantage for the Stellar ecosystem.

**We're ready to build. Let's unlock the future of private finance on Stellar.**

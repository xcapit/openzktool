# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| 0.2.0-poc | Yes | Current (PoC) |
| < 0.2.0 | No | Deprecated |

Note: This is a Proof of Concept. Not recommended for production without professional security audit.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

DO NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

1. Email: fboiero@frvm.utn.edu.ar
2. Subject: `[SECURITY] OpenZKTool Vulnerability Report`
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- Initial response: Within 48 hours
- Status update: Within 7 days
- Fix timeline: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 7-14 days
  - High: 14-30 days
  - Medium: 30-60 days
  - Low: Next release

## Security Measures

### Cryptographic Security

#### Groth16 SNARKs
- Algorithm: Groth16 proof system
- Curve: BN254 (alt_bn128)
- Security level: ~128-bit security
- Assumption: Computational Discrete Logarithm hardness

#### Trusted Setup
- Status: Using Powers of Tau ceremony
- Participants: Single-party (PoC only)
- Production: Multi-party ceremony required (100+ participants)
- Risk: Current setup is for testing only

WARNING: The current trusted setup is NOT secure for production. A multi-party ceremony is required before mainnet deployment.

### Smart Contract Security

#### Soroban Contract (Stellar)
- Language: Rust (no_std)
- Version: 4 (Complete BN254 pairing)
- Testing: 49 unit tests
- Audit status: Not audited
- Network: Testnet only

#### EVM Contract (Ethereum)
- Language: Solidity 0.8+
- Framework: Foundry
- Testing: Forge tests
- Audit status: Not audited
- Network: Local/testnet only

## Known Limitations (PoC)

### Critical Limitations

1. Trusted Setup
   - Single-party ceremony (NOT production-safe)
   - Toxic waste not destroyed
   - Multi-party ceremony required

2. No Security Audit
   - Contracts not audited by third party
   - Cryptographic implementation not formally verified
   - Use at your own risk

3. Test Networks Only
   - Deployed on testnets only
   - Not recommended for mainnet
   - No real assets should be used

4. Limited Testing
   - ~50% code coverage
   - No fuzzing tests
   - No formal verification

### Implementation Notes

1. Field Arithmetic
   - Montgomery form used
   - Overflow checks in place
   - No constant-time guarantees (timing attacks possible)

2. Pairing Implementation
   - Miller loop implemented
   - Final exponentiation optimized
   - Not reviewed by cryptography experts

3. Input Validation
   - Basic validation only
   - No advanced sanitization
   - Malicious inputs not extensively tested

## Security Roadmap

### Phase 1: Pre-Audit (Q1 2025)
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 95%
- [ ] Add fuzzing tests
- [ ] Implement constant-time operations where needed
- [ ] Multi-party trusted setup ceremony
- [ ] Third-party code review

### Phase 2: Audit (Q2 2025)
- [ ] Professional security audit by UTN FRVM Blockchain Lab
  - Francisco Anuar Ardúh (Principal Researcher)
  - Joel Edgar Dellamaggiore Kuns (Blockchain Specialist)
- [ ] Formal verification of critical functions
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Gas optimization audit

### Phase 3: Mainnet Ready (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Address all audit findings
- [ ] Public bug bounty program
- [ ] Continuous security monitoring
- [ ] Incident response plan

## Responsible Disclosure

### Disclosure Policy

1. Private reporting: 90 days before public disclosure
2. Coordinated disclosure: Work with team on fix
3. Public disclosure: After fix deployed
4. CVE assignment: For critical vulnerabilities

### Acknowledgments

We will publicly acknowledge security researchers who:
- Report valid vulnerabilities
- Follow responsible disclosure
- Allow time for fixes

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

1. Never use production keys with PoC contracts
2. Test on testnets only
3. Review all code before integrating
4. Use official repositories only
5. Keep dependencies updated

### For Smart Contract Deployers

1. Conduct own security review
2. Use multi-party trusted setup
3. Deploy to testnet first
4. Monitor for unusual activity
5. Have incident response plan

### For End Users

1. Only interact with audited contracts
2. Verify contract addresses
3. Start with small amounts
4. Understand risks
5. Keep wallets secure
